ACX coding Challenge

#How to run tests and the CLI?
Clone the project and run "mvn clean test" or "mvn clean verify". For your convenince, I have linked the project to Travis CI and the build status is displayed above. Run without varargs to convert the sample TXT file in the project.

#Choice of project
1800 coding challenge seemed the more interesting of the two problems because 
1.) Given the time constraints of having to travel and work, I picked something that I could probably code in 10 hours flat on my flight :)
2.)This is the first time I am doing pure TDD, I picked the one that was simpler so I could spend a couple of hours learning how to do TDD. (lifehack). 
3.) I ask a lot of interview candidates how to design a T9 dictionary to test their data structures knowledge, so I thought it'd be fun to actually code it for once. 

#Design and Approach
1. Breakdown the requirements and analyze test scenarios
2. Write down the test scenarios
3. Write test cases and methods to test these scenarios
4. Write modules to functionally satisfy this test methods.

#Test Scenarios

#Best Practices :
Trying TDD out for the first time tbh. The first project I have ever done pure TDD on. Also, technically this is the first pure Java project I've worked on. (Android/mobile/Microsoft server stack guy).

#Known Issues:
Not that I know of any.
